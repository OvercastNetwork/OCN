                You are registering your team for a tournament. Once all selected members of your team have confirmed their |
                participation, your registration will become finalized and unable to be reversed. Should your team be       |
                accepted, you (and all of your team members) will be held responsible for showing up to (and participating  |
                in) the tournament. Failure to do so is in violation of the tournament rules and will result in barring from
                future tournaments.

                    Submitting your registration will require each selected team member to confirm their participation.   |
                    Once all team members have confirmed their participation, your registration will become irreversible, |
                    and your team will be submitted for acceptance into the tournament. Please double-check your player
                    list before continuing.
